The Odin Project - Web Development 101 - Project: HTML/CSS

This repo is the HTML/CSS project in The Odin Project's Web Development 101 curriculum. 

Project Description: For this mini-project, you'll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don't worry if the links don't go anywhere and the search box doesn't do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you've actually tried to "build" something in HTML. -The Odin Project

Much of the code written was borrowed from other user projects. I was overthinking the CSS layout in failed attempts. I was not even aware of the <header> <footer> and <main> tags, and was confusing myself with too many IDs and Classes. After writing this and studying the code---changing and observing as I went---I think I have a much better understanding of CSS layout.
